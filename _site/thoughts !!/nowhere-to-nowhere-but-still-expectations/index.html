<p>Its  starts  from nowhere! where a soul gets life and a life gets a body and the body wastes some space!!</p>

<p>Ever wondered ,where we come from?where we are heading to?what we need?and why? for all these.. how a baby is destined to be born to particular couple? who plans this entire process ?</p>

<p>To my view, Life is nothing but a temporary stay in a well equipped gigantic hotel room (“The Earth”).we never realize the ultra thin span of this life because of the temporary pleasures and acquaintances.I was wondering what made that super power to direct me to this world ? Am I bound to enjoy the stay or do something that stands for a help ?</p>

<p>The best and the cutest period of this stay is “<strong>BABY’S TIME”.</strong></p>

<p>why all people love babies and why they are considered cute! lets think about it for a minute! <strong>ITS STARTS WITH A LOUD CRY! exclaiming to the world “I am one among you idiots”.And what makes them special is that “the never expect anything! all they need is just a milk bottle and full of happiness “.</strong></p>

<p>They never expect <strong>respect</strong>!they never expect <strong>response</strong> ! and when something was missing , they starts crying . About thoughts ,usually they don’t waste them. But the most surprising thing is their learning ability! Imagine a situation where you are in the middle of an empty space full of white, and u got no memory, no words ,no knowledge,nothing !! And you are about to start realize and think!</p>

<p>And this is the case with  a new born baby.<strong>THEY ARE THE BEST STUDENTS.THEY LEARN BY PRACTICE,BY SIGHT,BY HEARING,BY FEELING EVERYTHING NEW!!. And the sense of clarity of not expecting anything makes them CUTE!! </strong></p>

<p><strong>THE QUESTION IS,WHY BABIES ARE CONSIDERED CUTE AND LOVED BY ALL ,WHILE ADULTS LIKE US ARE NOT TREATED SO???</strong></p>

<p>The reason behind that is simple ! EXPECTATIONS..we start expecting respect from others! response from others!! and care much about what others think about us!! While the babies never do this..and thats wat make them special..</p>

<p>And it so continues to grow, to learn , to even expect like common Adult! joining the selfish community where it belongs to…Now we are grownups ! and here it starts - the development of selfish identity!</p>

<p>we step into the new era of so called tradition and fashion all over! we score acquaintances! we start thinking that its my life and Iam the one to take care of it! **SLOWLY THE ACQUAINTANCES GLOW MORE THAN THE TRUE RELATIONSHIPS AND LOVE ! CRUSHES BRUSH PEOPLE!! we start moving away from our parents. Its the period where we are bound to believe that these acquaintances to be true! and that’s where the problem starts! ** and it continues ,finally in search of the right one!! got it!!</p>

<p>And it contines, goes on and on! a self sustained group called family develops! new new cries and new new yells !! and chain extends and the <strong>realization phase</strong> begins.</p>

<p>In this we start realizing the truth! the reality when it happens to our juniors! we realize the impact of expectations as it will be hurt! we realize that we were wrong ! The truth begins! The search begins! . we become old! we feel that we are not so important to this hotel ! we start expressing ! we realize that no one hear us! and we become useless dappa!! so called grandpa !!</p>

<p><strong>and there you go!..towards nowhere once again! My dad used to talk about the “learning curve” that I definitely need to stress about!!! </strong></p>

<p>The learning curve is as follows!!</p>

<p><a href="http://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/learning-curve.gif"><img src="http://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/learning-curve.gif?w=300" alt="" /></a>The learning curve denotes the ability of life to observe things at different stages! The baby starts learning  and it grows–&gt;  the credit reaches the peak at 20 and starts declining so well <strong> AND THE DECAY OF INFORMATION REGARDING REALITY BEGINS..AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY OUR GRANDPARENTS USED TO YELL  ADVICES ,WHICH NO ONE CARE!!</strong></p>

<p><strong>AND IN THE END!! WHO ARE YOU? WHAT U HAVE DONE? DO I KNOW YOU?  and these are just that remain!! </strong></p>

<p><em>**</em>so my point is ,ITS CLEAR THAT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE NOTHING WITH US IN THE END!! THEN WHY IS SUCH A CRAZE OVER MONEY AND UNSTABLE PLEASURES? LETS HELP THE NEEDY !!</p>
