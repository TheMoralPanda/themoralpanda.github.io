<p>“His character is so bad!”, “Such a nice person she is!”,”Hell knows, what a person he is! “.How many comments have we passed about other’s character?  How many times have we said “This is who I am!”,”That’s who she is!”?How many occasions, have we felt bad when somebody comments about our character or in general tries to describe about us to someone else? Well I am sure, I have done a lot of those mistakes and experienced a few from others.<a href="https://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/character.jpg"><img src="https://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/character.jpg?w=300" alt="Character" /></a></p>

<p>I am actually very afraid of books. I could clearly count the number of books that I have read so far. One is a Greek mythology based story and the other is a kid’s novel. But I had a different experience recently. Of course it’s my third book!</p>

<p>It’s <strong>‘Personality Development’ from Swami Vivekananda</strong>. I started reading it because it’s got just 100 pages. In that book, there is one sentence that Swami Vivekananda exclaims about.</p>

<blockquote>"**Character is the repeated habits! And only repeated habits , alone can reform character**".

- **Swami Vivekananda **</blockquote>

<p>I got so impressed at this quote! This is the only line that I remember from the entire book, now. I was thinking what he really meant, in this brilliant quote. Then I came up with a totally different perspective upon it. Let’s look at the statement once again for clarity. He has explained that character is actually the impressions that we create with our habits. So that means, <strong>there is a possibility for a change</strong>! Of course the questions I have asked in the beginning of the post, is quite relevant to all of us. We are experiencing similar situations, in our day to day life. We are commenting about other’s character quite often. And we also have felt bad at different occasions, when somebody comments about us or to somebody else, which might be correct or sometimes not!</p>

<p>So I sat down, thinking why do we comment about others character? Why does my team mate, say such things about me?Then after some time, I modified the question a bit, and thought how do people judge me?</p>

<p>I finally realized that, my activities that I have demonstrated sometime and my behaviour that I express often made them think like that. Of course I am always interested in analyzing and improving me, because the <strong>opposite is not healthy and even virtually not possible</strong>. So I concluded that the problem is partially on me too. Then I made my mind up and was further analyzing about my activities and the impressions that I create the positives and the negatives of them. In the end, I learned something.</p>

<p>Of course the process of change is in progress for me. Wait! If this process is made in to a generic routine, everyone can use it! So I came up with below simple steps to change our character that Swami Vivekananda was exclaiming about.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>INTROSPECT YOURSELF</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>My father describes introspection like a scene and says “Bring the image of a court! You are the criminal and also the Judge. Now think in both the perspective and judge your action.” So analyse yourself and list down the opinions of others, which bother you.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>_<Note> Of course we can't consider every others opinion. List down, only from those that are close to you and from people who are precious to you._</Note></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>**FILTER **</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>From the list of opinions about your character, order them based on</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The reason for the opinion</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The possibility for a change.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>THE STUPID HABITS</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>This is the most important step. Write down the opinions on the left side .On the right side; write the list of your habits that cause those opinions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FLIP THE BOARD</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Try to flip the habits that cause those opinions, in a positive way.For instance:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>_“Always angry”__- _Put a smile whenever you see them!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>“Very silent”__-</em> Go say Hi to the neighbour! Ask about the recent film that he has watched!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>_“Jealous on someone”__- _call the same person and appreciate them!</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Give it a try and you will be amazed, by how they see you there after! Trust me!</p>

<p>There is no step 5! Because you are already a changed man!</p>

<blockquote> "But the most important point to remember here is, this is exactly how others feel too, when we comment about their character."  So let’s stop commenting on other's character because, it becomes out dated, when the target person has followed the steps.  Mind it!</blockquote>

<p>Our character is what we make it! What we do! And it can be changed!</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
