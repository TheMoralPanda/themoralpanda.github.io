<p>Ever felt so happy and complete, after spending a beautiful day with wonderful friends and heading back home, listening to your favorite music? Yes! I had one of the best days of my life. Of course the title would give the best answer, to why my day was so special. It was a brilliant day which was actually planned clearly, the day before. This close friend of mine, Ajeeth Kumar, who is also my colleague at Infosys, invited me for this short trip.I accepted. Meanwhile, a whatsapp group was created and discussions about the trip were going on.<img src="https://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/resort.jpg?w=300" alt="resort" /></p>

<p>The guys have decided to assemble at Kelambakkam bus stop at exactly at 9 am, the next day.  I started a bit late at 7.50 am from Guduvanchery and reached the spot around 9.15 am. It seems that the guys were really hungry and they were having a sound breakfast, at a hotel near Kelambakkam bus stop. I joined in between and had a tasty Poori with Aloo masala. We were 8 in numbers. Myself, Nivi - a body builder working in CTS, Yeshwa - a perfect event organizer who is also working in CTS, Sundar - a little bulk dude who has become an assistant professor, Ajeeth kumar - a colleague of mine at Infosys, Rajkumar - a serious dude who entertains us 24X7 with this jokes and who is actually going to Delhi next week to pursue his IAS coaching, Raghav - a friend of Rajkumar and a CTS employee and Sricharan - a old looking but super cool engineer. we had four bikes, few pulsars and a busty bullet ! After the breakfast, we traveled to the final spot, the Jade resort.This is my first trip to a resort. Jade resort is a budget one, with limited facilities, such as few indoor games and outdoor games, a swimming pool, a restaurant and a pitch for volley ball and a small beach. Its actually worth the money that we paid them.<img src="https://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/group-pic.jpg?w=300" alt="group pic" /></p>

<p>Once we reached the resort, we decided to start the day by playing Cricket. Actually AjeethKumar was late. So he came directly to the resort in his scooty. Yes ! He rode a scooty all the way from Saidapet to the resort via Thiruvanmayur. So we played Cricket for around two hours making jokes about each other and commenting at each other’s game. No one scored a good runs. We were spending most of our time searching for the ball, that we hit accidentally outside of the ground. Ultimately one of the shot threw the ball so far and so long that we actually lost it. Then we paid a fine amount of Rs.50 for the lost ball. Yes! we got little tired and so we decided to chill at the swimming pool. We got back to the office and had few rounds of free juice that they provided.</p>

<p>Then we moved to the pool area. Actually the Swimming pool keeper didnt allow us, with the kind of trousers that we had. He asked us to enter the pool only in nylon trousers. So Sundar and Ajeeth went outside and bought us all , a pair of nylon trousers. Then we entered the pool. We spent almost two hours in the water chilling and playing some interesting games. One among them was, ‘Searching The Coin’. A person will throw a coin in to the pool, while other guys remain closing the eyes or facing in the opposite direction.And once he threw the coin, the guys will search for it and the person who picks it up first, is the winner ! And none of us knew proper swimming. So we all practiced and learnt a bit. Two hours left and we took some selfies too. It was a complete fun. So we all got little hungry. So we came out of the pool and dressed up deciding to have Lunch.</p>

<p>Actually we came out of the resort, to a good hotel, to have lunch. The lunch was good. We started with few Soups and dove directly into the main items. We bought few Rotis and Subjis and fried rices too. An hour passed, with the loud burps beeping, we decided to finish. We actually have eaten for Rs.2000. But yes, It was worth it.</p>

<p>Then we drove back to the resort and decided to play few indoor games. We started with Table Tennis and Snooker. None of us have played snooker before. So, as usual we started advising each other and commenting each others moves, in the game. It was total fun. But boy! the real snooker is far difficult to play when compared to the computer game. Meanwhile two among us, were playing Table Tennis. Now is the most interesting part. Some random family including a pretty young woman, came in to the sports arena and joined us to play Table Tennis. It was fun. I meant both the game and staring at the beautiful girl. It went almost few hours and then we decided to hand over the sports items at the office and we went to the beach.</p>

<p><img src="https://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/beach.jpg?w=300" alt="beach" />It was a simple but a lovely private beach. It was like heaven especially when the rain started pouring. These guys actually decided not to get into the sea and stayed in the shore playing Catch&amp;Catch with a tennis ball brought by one of my friends. I actually decided to head on the sea and chill. I walked alone towards the water and decided to get my feet dipped in it. But then the waves were brilliant and that changed my mind. I decided to dip myself in completely. Slowing it started raining heavier. I laid on the edge of the shore, looking at the sky and slowly feeling the chill waves tickling on my feet. It was heaven. Trust me ! the best time to enjoy a beach is during chill rain and an awesome weather. The sea stood magnificent. I got this superb feeling that this is turning to be the one of the best days of my life.</p>

<p>Slowly we dragged ourselves out of the beach as it was getting late and reached the office. We waited there for few minutes, for the rain to come down, so that we could start our journey return. But the rain didn’t seem to come down. So we started from there. I was sitting behind Nivi, in his Pulsar. None of us rode at high speed. Instead we were riding at normal speeds, enjoying the visuals at either sides of the road. The rain got heavier. But boy it was brilliant. This is the first time, I am actually riding in a bike, in ECR, during rain and especially during an awesome weather. It was heaven.</p>

<p>We reached the Kelambakkam bus stand. We were little hungry and decided to have a tea <img src="https://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/dsc_0046.jpg?w=300" alt="DSC_0046" />and a sandwich. We were discussing how the day was and had few laughs at our memories that we gathered during our college days, especially about the girls whom we had crush on. Then I decided to take a bus from Kelambakkam to my place. Those guys continued their bike rides to their respective places. I got a bus to my place and on the way back, I was listening to my favorite musician A.R.Rahman’s ‘Ok Kanmani’ album. The weather was good and the music multiplied the joy.</p>

<p>I started feeling so good. So pinged all those guys saying a big thanks for hosting the trip and for inviting me especially. I pinged them that this was one of the best days of my life and it was because of them. I promised them that I will write a blog post about this today and will share it with them.</p>

<p>This is that post !
This post is actually dedicated to all those guys ! [ Nivi, Ajeeth, Sundhar, Yeshwanth, Raghav, RajKumar ]</p>

<p>Thank you so much guys ! Love you loads ! :)
I simply can’t wait for the next trip to happen !</p>

<p>P.S -&gt; I came home and talked to my dad. I told him that I had the best day of my life with the friends. He was happy. I told him that I should get a bike for me. I should roam around places and enjoy the world! He agreed and said “Yes ! pretty soon !”</p>

<p>Thanks to God too ! :)</p>
