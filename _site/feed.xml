Oops even now…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To My View, there is nothing called a synonym.Lets take this example .Whats this ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/apple-61.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/apple-61.jpg?w=148&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Realize this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We usually call this as an apple.Ok! who taught you that this is an apple?or lets take this. we were taught when we we’re in KG’s, and we are asked to follow that. when you ask the same question to your teacher or elders in general , they might have the same answer. Lets think about the orgin of languages or even communication for instance !we never realize why we are asked to call this NewtonTool as an apple ? Its the artificially created logic of the world that “ mandatory should always be mandatory”.when Adam was very hungry he might have shouted at Eve “guuuiiiivvv meeyeeeee aaaaaapppllllaaaaaa” as he was interested in this beautiful eatable, who Knows ??? Later on , It would be called as apple…a synonym for a word or a reference for a thing is assumed when it is followed by many.So its not a big thing even one masters Oxfords advanced english dictionary, since he had grazed on a virtual land.funny rite?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so its an assumption that created the synonym,the reference for understanding.To all those who seek uniqueness- you are still following the beaten track ! However science is not like that.science has proof though it involves assumptions and predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So people who are less effective in language vocabulary should not be discouraged , since they are at least trying to unique . So what about you ?huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just an idea or a simple view..Please think over it :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vigneshwar</name></author><summary type="html">Do you really think a synonym is actually a synonym?.. Oops even now…</summary></entry></feed>
