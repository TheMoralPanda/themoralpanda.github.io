Recently, In a popular Tamil television channel program, where they debate on
various social topics, a discussion on Men’s perception on women happened. We
all know that this is huge argumentative topic that is around recently, in
India. In one episode, there was an argument that why Women can’t drink ? Its
their choice? Its their freedom?

I would rather not call my below suggestion, an Answer to this question. But I
would instead, call it a perception. And I request all indian women, to think
about it, especially women of TamilNadu. Ok. So the question is

> Why women should not drink and drug and party hard, like the way stupid Men do?

> One line. **Because you are precious to us.** I know this question is very
> biased and it affects the fundamental freedom. Infact I agree, that both Men and
Women are equal and they have all rights and freedom to be who they really are.

> But you women! You guys are the precious jewels and pearls of our country. In
> our rich Indian tradition, especially the Tamil culture, you guys are always the
best. Behind the success, behind the great achievements, behind every little
family , an Indian woman stands strong, holding things together.

> we are saying that you belong there, the top level, the crown, especially in
> tamilnadu. You guys are our Tamil Nadus treasure. And one more fact, there
happens a lot of crime because of drunk Men. The fact that, there are lot of
accidents, rapes and other utterly stupid stuff happening because of drunk
people in India, is so sad. And our government and people are already worried
about it so much and are trying desperately to solve that already existing
problem. So its your kind duty to help us get rid of the habit and become better
and not fight to become like us.

> So why do you guys want to come down from the level of diamonds to the level of
> ground level carbons. Lets say you drink and drug and do things like that, but
you are our only hope. Women have the ability to change people and to make it a
better place. You can change a man from doing bad things. You can be the change.

So thats why I believe you guys are requested not to drink and not to follow our
stupid habits. We want to you to remain strong and steady and help us become
clean and get rid of our habits. You are our hope.

So the real question should be *why should not anyone drink* ?

My friends drink, drug and party hard. So one day, I asked my dad, Why should I
not drink or drug? I am not causing any harm to anyone. Why cant I do that?

> He said, when u drink or when u drug, you reach a totally different mental and
> physical state, which is abnormal. Even though it gives you pleasure, it takes
you to different level, where you are loosing your real self. So the rule of
thumb is anything that takes you to abnormal dimension, is not healthy.

His answer was not biased. He didn’t say that I should not drink. He just said
its not healthy. In fact I understood, why would I desperately want to change my
state of being, to an abnormal dimension, where I am loosing my real self for a
petty pleasure.

So women, in our tamil culture, in India, you guys are very precious. You are
our hope. So please try to be in the level of jewels and helps us come out of
ground level carbon layer.

P.S I am a **teetotaler. **I respect women so much. And I want them to help us. �No offence to people who drink or drug or party. Its clearly a suggestion.
Thanks.
