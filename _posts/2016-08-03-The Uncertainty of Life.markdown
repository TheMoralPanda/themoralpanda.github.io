<span class="figcaption_hack">Its a choice!</span>

Ever realized, how changing our lives are? If you look at our world, the only
word that describes it exactly, is “Change”. Everything is constantly changing.
Sometimes positively and sometimes negatively. It seriously seems like a roller
coaster ride. Leave the world. Look at us. Are we the same who we used to be? At
least, are we the one whom, we want to be? One moment we are so happy and
exuberant and on the other we are absolutely miserable. One of the noble truths
that the Great Buddha aka Gautama Siddhartha has informed the world is,

> “Life is like a river flowing on and on, ever-changing. Sometimes it flows
> slowly and sometimes swiftly. It is smooth and gentle in some places, but later
on snags and rocks crop up out of nowhere. As soon as we think we are safe,
something unexpected happens” — The Buddha

So if Life by itself, is uncertain, how can we make our experiences, certain?
How can we continue being happy or increase the happiness streak? How can we
make sure, that our journey is going to be pleasant overall? These questions
have haunted me so far. So after reading messages of various philosophies, the
below is what I can sum up, as my understanding.

The simple answer that I could say is “ We can’t. We can’t confirm that we are
safe. We can’t confirm, that whatever is yet to happen, is gonna be pleasant.
No. Seriously we can’t.”

> But, the only key that is available to us, is the way we handle them. Yes.
> Seriously, we can. An emotion is always a reaction that is triggered to an
event. A feeling is a reaction to the emotion. An action is a reaction to a
feeling or a motive. So its always a reaction.

So indirectly, we have control. Not on what happens to us. But on how we handle
them. And the sweetest part of this, is the fact that it is our choice. Whatever
happens, we can either turn it into a fortune or get wounded. So at every
moment, every event, we have the choice. Even when something bad happens to us,
we have a choice. We can sit there and cry the crap out. Or we can find the best
thing that we can do, at that moment. Its always this moment that we have
control over. At this moment, how to be happy? What’s the best thing that we can
do?

So if we start doing our best at every moments, Its also a way of ensuring that
our experiences are pleasant. An experience is of two aspect. An event and an
impact. We have very less control over the events. We also have less control
over the impact. But we have absolutely 100% control on how to handle the
impact. So indirectly, we have control over the impact. So, that I believe, is
my understanding of this uncertainty aspect of Life and a simple approach to
handle it.
