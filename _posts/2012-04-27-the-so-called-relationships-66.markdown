**Is relationship that simple to think?**

In 4th std,some lovely cute classmate of us in nice orange frock seems to bother us more.Unfortunately she would be a top scorer.So we study just for competing with her.Later on at 8th grade our activities seem to change in favor of a lovely little lady in nice short chudi however our studies wont be the nice work to compete with.It goes and goes and there you go, at High school in the course of completing your school education,that lovely lady,beautiful looking ah you feel as if you could crush the entire mountain just for her.OH sadly u complete your school finally getting the flavor of higher education.Our family will be quite busy between march--july , and finally got a seat.




We become  Freshmen to a famous college.We will find new friends,gain some confidence to talk with girls.And Believe me the first semester GPA we get would be the highest.Slowly it goes.Gang formation starts.All around fun going on.Sadly we will come across people buzzing the term **GIRLFRIEND**/**BOYFRIEND**. Friends consider the one with a gf/bf is gethu.And there we go finally got one.Mokka messages,DSLR magic,Facebook relationship statuses,lame outing rule us .We would lose control over our studies.And we spend time.It fakes us to be happy.Finally by the end of college life, we ****beg for a placement in a company and got it. Unfortunately the partner might be interested in higher studies. **And he/she says "Sorry.I gotta go abroad.And we can just be friends.Sorry.Be in touch."**

Ahem our relationship is worth a great sorry ! ahem ! Little sad.Days pass.Finally in a company.Years pass.Party,Fashion,Money rule us.Here the term "BOYFRIEND/GIRLFRIEND" becomes practical and easy.We will party,waste money and health.He or she would bother you very less.We get attracted to many.But the sad fact is




"**When it comes** to the talk on marriage and life, the word sorry sprouts." Very Little Sadness.Years pass.Finally family comes in to focus.Mom stressing us to see photos.Matrimony,Family wealth,House rule us.Finally picked one.Lead it.Settled.**The thirst should at least stop there else **it becomes a problem.




Here we are




**Where on earth is the true love?What does Relationship got to do with us?**




We used to hear about fantasy stories and true love from olden days.It was there.Believe me this trend and western culture which we think as advanced and modern is forcing us to lead a stupid life.They reduce the grip that we possess on our life.We saw above how we tend to amuse things and assume them as love and finally dropping it.




**Nowadays "relationships" come as a pair with "break-up"**.




Our Grandparents,parents all had true love.Its not because they are old.Its because they had patience.Its not that arranged family supported marriages lead to true love.Even history has beautiful love stories.They remained not just stories but as an incidents of remembrance for us.They taught us how love has to be.




It should be in your breadth.You should even give your life to get her.She should be the one who balances all your activities,one who understand you,one who thinks always about you,one who believes that u are her everything and finally one who lives for you.The only breakup is your death in the end.




Sadly this remains a piece of imagination in these days.So




to all who are in **so called relationship** --> **THINK**




to all who are single-->"**Your safe.Lets wait"**
