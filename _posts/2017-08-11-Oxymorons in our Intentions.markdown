Google defines an Oxymoron - a noun - a figure of speech in which apparently contradictory terms appear in conjunction (e.g. faith unfaithful kept him falsely true ). So Recently a thought came in to my mind. We as people exhibit a lot of oxymorons in our intentions. Below is a small collection of oxymorons in our intentions that I could remember. Please add on to this list. Its a funny one. :)

1. <u> நீங்க தப்பா எடுத்துகலணா..நான் </u> - We know clearly that they are going to thappa eduthufy, right after we say, what we are about to say. But still we do say it. 
2. <u>தெரியாம தான் கேக்குறேன்</u> - Bloody hell! we are only therinjae asking. This is brutally sarcastic.
3. <u>நான் சொல்றத வச்சி என்ன எடை போடாத</u> - I am gonna say whatever my mind shits. But make sure you dont judge me! Peace! :)
4. <u>If you don’t mind</u> - Please don't mind this. I need a favor.
5. <u>நான் அதை தப்புனு சொல்லள, ஆனா</u> - Whatever you have done is wrong. Just change that god damn thing. 
6. <u>நான் உன்னை குறை சொல்லள, ஆனா</u> - Here is a ponnadai of ur stupid things you have done. 

We all do this. More often really. We wanna do/say something. But we polish it and create a wonderful oxymoron in our intentions.
