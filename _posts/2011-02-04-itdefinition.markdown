[![](http://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/it.jpg?w=300)](http://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/it.jpg)**Oxford** says   "the study or use of systems (especially computers and telecommunications) for storing, retrieving, and sending information"

**Websters** says   "the study, design, development, implementation, support or management of computer-based information systems, particularly software applications and computer hardware."

Do you think Information technology is just this???????

I just cant believe IT treated just for computing and telecommunications. Here is my view of What IT is all about ?Do follow me to go behind BC's.

To my view IT is the backbone of almost all processes existing in the universe.UNIVERSE is made up of millions of interconnected- processes. Each process is associated with** 3 P's** .

[![](http://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/new-picture-2.jpg?w=300)](http://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/new-picture-2.jpg)PURPOSE specifies what the process is intended to do.PRIORITY describes the order of execution of various sub resources involved in the process and PATTERN OF OPERATIONS specifies in what order the various sub resources should be executed to achieve the desired purpose.The following example best suits this IDEA.

Lets take this simple example[![](http://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/picture-7.png?w=300)](http://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/picture-7.png)

The above is a simple picture demonstrating a simple process " glowing of a bulb when switched ON".Lets go somewhat deep in to it. The purpose of this process is to glow light ultimately.The available various resources are "Bulb,switch,connecting wires and electricity (i.e electrons)".

PATTERN OF OPERATIONS :



	
  1. The switch should be triggered ON.

	
  2. Next the electrons should start flowing through the wires

	
  3. The flowing electrons should heat the metal in bulb and hence the bulb glows.


SO THE PRIORITY IS AS FOLLOWS :

	
  1. Switch.

	
  2. Motion of electrons.

	
  3. bulb being triggered.


_why cant we have like this? Think ..Let the bulb glows first -> then the electrons pass through wires -> and then the switch may be triggered ON. Or in any order , you like _? 

SO WHAT MY IDEA SAY IS THAT , the purpose  and the priorities of available resources comes under "INFORMATION",and the pattern of operations under "TECHNOLOGY". So here in this example .

LIGHT GLOWING PROCESS - the INFORMATION are " purpose  - to give light, and the priorities of the available resources such as 'switch(1),Motion of electrons(2),Bulb being triggered(3)' " and the TECHNOLOGY is when electrons are accelerated the collide among them and produce large scale energy which heats filament and hence light "


For a process to happen the available resources should be prioritized and should be regulated in the destined order.

Lets take another example.In Olden days the kings used to send their sweet love messages to their "QUEENS" :-P (note that its plural :-P) . OK ..They use DOVES to send their messages.lets analyze this simple process .

In this process, the purpose is the king wants to communicate his intention to queen,and the available resources are dove,information,paper, and the pattern of operations are



	
  1. sketch data in the paper

	
  2. hung it in birds legs

	
  3. direct the bird in right direction and send it


Thus for this process to happen every step as mentioned above should happen in the destined order.So in this example the INFORMATION  includes " the purpose - communicating his intention to queen, and priority of the available resources such as  Pen down info(1),hung it on birds legs(2),train it in right direction and send(3) " and the Technology used is " Dove can carry a piece of paper  from one place to another" .

Even this is same going on in natural processes too.[](http://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/plant_growth.jpg)[![](http://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/photosynthesis-color.jpg?w=300)](http://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/photosynthesis-color.jpg)


So Lets take this photosynthesis  process as example . 

INFORMATION

purpose : to grow ,bear fruits  and flowers,

priorities : as u see in the above diagram



	
  1. absorb solar energy

	
  2. convert water and light to food

	
  3. transfer to other parts


TECHNOLOGY

carbondioxide +water + co2  = food for plants

So any process is associated with Information and technology. So we can say IT is the backbone of all processes.BUT there is another major fact to be considered "TIME".So any process happens between "START" and "STOP".**So  thinking what separates start and stop?** I got the answer "TIME" .

So Its the time that separates start and stop, between which a process happens behind which INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY lies. **IMAGINE AN UNIVERSE  WITH NO TIME???**

The answer is" **NOTHING**". SO for each and every process to happen , time paves the path , IT defines them.Hence if we see in this view, then

_**"TIME IS THE KING OF UNIVERSE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IS THE SUCCESSOR OF TIME "**_ ....

SO TO MY VIEW, Information technology is not just what we say.Its something far apart. IT's origin can be described as the start of universe,the beginning of processes.But man has redefined the identity.

**THIS IS OUR TRUE IDENTITY PEOPLE!**!!! Information technology  is not just computer and stuff.

this is my definition of information technology.view it in this perpective.

**PROUD TO BE AN 'IT' -IAN**!!!

I dedicate my view to my dad who taught me the entire world.Hats of to you dad. :) :)
