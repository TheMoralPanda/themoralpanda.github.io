We all love Music. Different genres. Different instruments . Different tunes. Everybody knows that. I am gonna talk about music in general. All I want to think about is ,  why music is so cool ?And why almost all people are really in love with it ? A simple answer might be , that listening to it makes one feel so good and that would be it for most of us. But we have to think a bit deep in here. If Music makes you feel so good, you should be enjoying almost any type of music. **But its not the case mostly. We wont like every song and composition. Our wish list is always limited. Why why why ? **

**( Chandler's why ?..)  **

Its primarily because we wont always feel good on listening to every song. So my whole point here is , the Mood that we have at the moment i.e the type of feeling we experience currently determines the ability of us to like a particular tune mostly. But there are few exceptions when some people just listen to music just to experience its purity and the flow. Lets leave them. It doesn't matter which age group you belong to! There is always a set of tunes that we cherish.

Most of the times when a baby is disturbed and not feeling good, **the Mom used to lay him on the cradle and swing it a bit singing a mild song**. I am not sure about the foreign habit equivalent to this. But this is mostly the case in India . And the baby feel relaxed and finally fall into sleep. The reason I think for this is because, Babies when  they are disturbed  they don't feel good  and they obviously cant figure out anything. So when mom sings,  they are submerged into a strong soothing belief, that every thing is taken care of and they are protected .So finally they forget all their worries and fall in to deep sleep. So the tune that Mom sings doesn't do the magic. Its the feeling the babies associate with it, does.

Lets take Adults. we hear a hell lot of music. Mostly the powerful and energetic ones . We enjoy music a lot.  I have a lot of friends who listen to different kinds of music often. For instance some would always listen to rocking numbers that makes people dance in general , to make them feel good. Some would always listen to soft tunes which make them feel normal most of the times. Some people always listen to sad tunes that make them feel convinced for whatever the loss they had emotionally. I still remember that when I was in college , I personally used to listen to  so called **Rising songs ! like the Dark knight rises theme by Hans , Thozha Munnal vaada song by Rahman etc ** to make me feel ready before exams and presentations and seminars. They motivate me a lot.  **

Old people listen to spiritual songs and good old songs that convey most of good characters and morale ! M.S.V numbers do that magic. So the whole point here is Music and Emotions go hand in hand.


<blockquote>Music kindle our emotions. And it return our Emotions choose our music most of the times. So we have to understand that we use Music as a tool to support us morally  and thats how we like it. If  by any chance we could separate them and listen to music all alone , that would taste so good I hope ! And we would start liking a lot more  I guess ! We all should try it !</blockquote>
