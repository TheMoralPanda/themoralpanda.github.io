Sitting here in my office, an hour before breaking for Lunch, worrying about my hurtful past memories, I decided to call my mom. Its been quite a few days since I spoke to her. Although I don't want to talk about my worrying thoughts, I just thought I could distract myself from the melancholic cloud, by talking to my mom. My mom proved yet again, she is one of a Kind. Its not like another 'My Parents are the best' post. In fact my Mother is very different. To tell about her in a nutshell, I can tell you the following habit of her and my Dad, that is so unique and different from most of the parents.

During our school days, all of us would have encountered an angry teacher saying **Bring your parents tomorrow to meet me!** due to such situations, be it as a result of a small fight with our classmate, or some mischief. Especially if we are not completely meant to be blamed, Most of the parents would go there, protecting us. Some would go there, and try to apologize. But my mom, used to take me there and beat me, asking what did I do? She says, even if I am not completely responsible, I would have been responsible for some percent of the situation. So I used to get nicely from my teachers and then once again from my parents in front of the teachers.

So the point is, She always ensured, that I am doing clear. And that I am focused on introspecting myself and changing myself. Even if the events turn out difficult and even if some one does something to me, she ensured, that I am **not reacting** with anger but with **introspecting within myself, _over what I did and what I should not do_**. And that I believe was the key that helped me grow. I was lucky to have been taught that kind of approach. Okay. Lets me just list of the key good points that my mom followed and taught us to do. The point is not to boast that I have got the best mother in the world. But to share the key principles of my strong and noble mother.

* When I came home crying, after one of my schoolmates, scolded me in a really bad word in **6th grade**, She took me to the pooja room and asked me to promise, that I will never ever use such really bad words, never ever like my friend did. _First I confessed, that I also used to utter such words in school and I promised that I will never ever use it_.

* I was in a relationship with a girl for a long time. But that girl broke up with me brutally knowing her parents said a clear **No** , for us because I belonged to a different caste. And the most important part is, she never ever said a Sorry. I was miserable. Deeply in depression for few months. And I was burning with anger that how could she do this such brutally without even asking a single sorry. My mother was next to me when she broke up with me, over a message. I was crying like hell. I was burning with anger. And I was shouting "I am gonna go to her family and say it out whatever happened between us. To slam their family bringing out the details! ". But my mother stopped me and she said this in Tamil. " முள்ளு மேல சேலை விழுந்தாலும், சேலை மேல முள்ளு விழுந்தாலும், கிழியிறது சேலைதான்..இந்த கோவத்தை கட்டு படுத்து.. அந்த பொண்ணு உனக்கு என்ன பன்னிர்த்தாலும் சேரி.. விட்டுடு... கடவுள் பத்துகுருவாரு.
அவளும் அவள் குடும்பமும் நல்ல இருக்கட்டும்!
கோவத்தை விட்டுடு! உன்ன அழுச்சிடும்! "

* You would not believe how miserable I was at that moment. How desperate I was. The truth is, the girl ended it horribly. There was not even a single sorry in her face. Even though I am the victim of a serious event here, look at the words my mom said. Now compare it with my ex's mom, whose first question to my ex about me is ,  "Is he a Brahmin?, before even asking my name and then the next word is "No. And she threw my photo away"!

* My mother always believed and dedicated to God. Even if I come home claiming I got a seat in SSN College, she says "கடவுளுக்கு நன்றி சொல்லு". And ask me to directly go to the pooja room and pray to thank.

Trust me! This thought of introspecting ourselves, this question of What I did and what I should not do, irrespective of what happens to us, is seriously important. Because, we all know that Change happens from within. We all know, we should take of our actions. But somehow, we end up with anger, misery and resentment. We react before we think. We worry about our image, because of our Ego.

And because of such wonderful ideals taught by my mom, I chased that girl who broke up with me, after 6 months and asked "Sorry myself". And said, "என்னால உனக்கும் உன் குடும்பத்துக்கும் எதாவது பிரச்னை வந்திருந்த, என்ன மன்னிச்சுடு." I said sorry and I wished her good luck, even after how she treated me. Because I felt guilty for, how she treated me. And after setting things straight, I can move on.

Life is too short to be angry, to be grumpy, to be arrogant.
And most importantly "Knowing is not enough! We must apply. Willing is not enough! we must do"
