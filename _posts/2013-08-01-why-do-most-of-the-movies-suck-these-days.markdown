Ya , We are in the age where Technology and Media have grown to a great extent  that Information travels so fast. People get information blindly in a matter of seconds of its occurrence via Social Media be it an original one or a fake message. So why is that relevant here ? 

We all watch Movies. Some do it regularly whenever a movie releases. Some watch them if it includes his or her favorite actors and actresses ! Some watch it for time pass. Some watch it seriously. Some watch it for comedy ! 

We all know , most of movies suck nowadays ! All I am keen to know is , Do they seriously suck or its something else ? Lets go step by step !

**_What are the most likely issues that make a movie suck so much ?_**

  * **Movie specific issues --) **The Movie really sucks ! this includes reasons like (  Lame story , says something that cant be accepted , shows something that cant be watched etc)
  * **People specific Issues --) ** If your friends said that movie sucks , If your **Facebook wall** is filled with posts that slams so bad about the movie, If  you **pre- assume** that the movie will suck when it releases.

All I want to focus on is about the **People Specific Issues ! ** **Since Most of the movies these days fail or suck so bad because of the second issue !  **Lets go back to good old days where a lot of stars ruled Cinema with their wonderful acting ! And the good old directors ruled people's hearts with wonderful movies !

How do you think most of the MGR and Sivaji  movies ran successfully all the time ? Well one might argue that ,Technology has not grown enough at that time, Competitions were minimum between the actors ! Well that is not true ! If you take any of those movies and play it now , It will contain a great story and its still watchable. But that is not my point in here. !  Why do most of the recent movies suck ? **The better question to every man will be, Do the Movie really sucks or its just what you heard about it ?**

What I feel is that , a lot of recent movies are good !  It has got a great story line  and that the technology has grown so much , we are getting good context and clarity in movies ! Cinema has seriously developed.  Lets take a look at the steps that is usually followed by common man these days !

  1. The trailer of the movie get released ! - We watch it , Fans get high ! Critics get high too in the opposite sense ! Common Man waits for the movie !
  2. The movie gets released ! Unfortunately everyone cant be able to watch it on first day ! So we should anyway watch in over the weekend or next ! But we wont wait . When we open our facebook account , our wall will be filled with random comments about the movie ! Most of them would be in negative sense !
  3.  We gradually come to a conclusion that the movie sucks and slowly will delay our scheduled plan of watching the particular movie and finally dropping it !

What happens when almost all the people in state or even the country follows it ? ** The result is that Movie will anyway fails ! ******

So my point here is ? **Its not just the movies that suck ! Its we who talk much about it without watching , we argues a lot of what the movie has ,before actually watching it , its we who listens to others views about the movie and pre assume that its bad !**

What I am trying to say in here  is not  against the **Right to speak or Right to review ** or something like that. What I am trying to say is **Everyone has a unique taste ! **Some like Dosai ! Some like Idly ! Doesn't mean both of them sucks !**  
**

So what **I request you guys is ?**

<blockquote>Please don't Listen to others views about the movie , before you actually watch it ! Have an Original Opinion ! Its You who are going to watch it ! Its what you like that matters ! Don't Pre assume stuff  about the movie and watch it then ! 
> 
> Before watching every movie , prepare yourself with the positive thought that the movie will be good ! and then watch it ! If its good , then remember it  and if its not just forget it and don't force your opinion to others !
