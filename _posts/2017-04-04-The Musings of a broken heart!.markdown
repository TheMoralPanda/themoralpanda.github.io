Ever wondered, what does a broken heart ponders about? How it struggles and learns to pick itself up, after falling terribly? How it goes through the random raids by past memories, both pleasant and miserable ones? How it constantly tries to erase those chains of images of both good and bad times? Especially when it knows, what it should do, how it should move on. While the world is full of cliche answers and clues, the experience of a heart is always unique. So even though it has numerous solution right at its hand, the suffering is always unique.

The context of this particular experience of a broken heart is of lost love. By the way, why does it got hurt in the first place? What does a heart essentially do, when it comes to love? It jumps to bond. It tries to be one, even though it knows, they are two different ones, both in terms of identity and in terms of ideals. The desperation often starts so successful, that it starts to believe that they both are made for each other. So you could imagine, like a pair of elements bonded together. And the universe is like a giant ball, inside which trillion pairs of elements roaming around. There are many different bonds among them. Some are double bonds, so strong, so powerful. Some are single bonds, one among the pair has bonded while the other is partially bonded. One is empowering and the other has got entangled. In some pairs, there are no bonds at all. But just roaming together without any affection between them.

And now, how does this heart react when its bond is broken, by the other element? It cries. It weeps. It wonders how the hell it could happen? It ponders why it did not happen? It struggles to see the present. Every song it hears, every pair it sees, this heart questions about what happened to itself? And the most important thing is, it wont be able to find an answer. People say, the reality is the answer. But why it happens for this little fellow? Everyone anticipate. Everyone wish for things. But why should this happen to this little heart? The world is full of wonderful bonds. But why does a strong bond which was wonderful, shatters into absolute mess.

If you look at the complete timeline, of this hearts experience, right in the beginning is a lot of good times. Happy moments. Precious memories. But right after its beaten to its knees, it starts to focus on all the bad memories located in the end of the timeline. We cannot blame him completely. For the reality is that, its over. Even though it remembers the pleasant memories, it ponders over the miserable ones. The words uttered when it was dumped, starts whispering uncontrollably making him feel less alive.

The constant lies behind the reality. Most of the times, it fails to accept the reality. It struggles to understand its over. Essentially because, it started believing in miracles, right in the beginning of the timeline, when it was successfully able to bond. It slowly goes in to a limbo state where it constantly lies to itself, that miracle can once again happen. Things might get back to to how it was, in the beginning of the timeline. It only accepts that its over, when it sadly comes to know that the other heart has moved on. That one has bonded with somebody else.

Another huge struggle it shall go through, is to forgive or hate. If the mind advises him, to forget, he spit hate. If the mind asks him to hate her, he tries to forgive. Should the other one be really forgiven or not? Its a question that only reality can answer. But one important attribute of the reality is that, it is neutral. We can call it many names. Karma, Truth etc. Its neutral. It has got powers to make miracle happen once again. Or it can even cause the misery to the other one and make it realize the truth. But the unfortunate thing about this, the broken heart has no control over it.

But if both of them are really not meant to be together, then reality will definitely teach this broken fellow, to step up. To change the course. To feel motivated once again. To pick himself up. But if they are meant to be together, it will pull them both together, back again. Unfortunately, both these heart can't know, whats going to happen.

Whatever happens, I hope the reality will repair him and give him enough strength to walk once again. To fly once again. Because this heart doesn't deserve anything less. And Life is far bigger than trillion musings.
