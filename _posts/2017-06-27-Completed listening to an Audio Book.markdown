Audio books are around quite a long time. But I got interested for the first time, after reading an email from Quincy Larson. FYI, Larson is the co-founder of Freecodecamp.com, an open and free learning site focused essentially on web development. Its very useful one. Larson owns a mailing list, via which he shares really useful contents such as, blogs about technology, success stories from freecodecamp users and occasionally about some interesting tech articles and book reviews. So in one of such mailers, he introduced an audio book called "The Fourth Transformation: How Augmented Reality & Artificial Intelligence will change Everything, By Robert Scoble, Shel Israel".

This book is an eye opening book about how AI is the next big thing, in fact the current best thing. How AI will reach the world in multiple platforms and via various technologies right from HMD (Head mounted displays) to Wrist watches to further more pervasive technologies.

He has mentioned as (5 hour listen) next to the title of the audio book, in that email. Instantly I got interested and followed by clicking on that link. It lead me to the Amazon's audio book market place called, Audible.

Amazon's Audible is the best audio book application+web store, that currently exist. Almost many book publishers started publishing an audio version of their popular old books and their latest ones via Audible.

The best part about Audible, is the audio books are narrated by some decent narrators who have lend their voices narrating the book. So the point is, The books are read to you like how people read stories to their young children.

The fact is Audible lets you try free for one month, though it collects your credit card information prior to it. Once you register, it will give you one credit which you can use it to download any book. Ideally a book cost 1 credit. The option available to us is that we can exchange the book anytime to download a new book, if we feel so. But the books we have completed, will be available to us completely, even if we cancel our subscription. After the free initial trial month, the subscription costs 15USD per month, which is roughly 970Rupees/month. It seems costly, but I feel its worth it, because of a different experience.

This book about AI and Virtual Reality is not the first book for me to complete. When you sign up for the first time, the first book worth a credit, is free. So I signed up, downloading this AI book to my phone. Then in order to use the first month free trial, I used that extra credit, to buy another audio book. Its "The Power of Habit: Why we do what we do and how to change, by Charles Duhigg". So I had two books in my phone and I was listening to it in parallel, switching between the two. This second book about habits is the one, I have finished listening to, first. So this is technically my first ever complete audio book experience. I will write a short review about that book in a separate blog.

- Excellent audio quality plus a proper human narration instead of a robot voice.
- Complete audio book offline, split into multiple chapters was attractive.
- +30/-30 second forward/rewind was highly useful. Plus skipping chapters is also an option.

But the most important thing with audio books was the experience. I am a person with very good memory. And after listening to chapter by chapter, slowly and steadily, I am able to clearly list down, what are the insights, from the book.

Generally when we read a book, we end up with a feel. But this audio book and the voices behind important passages reminds in your brain. At least for me. Its really good. Give it a try.
