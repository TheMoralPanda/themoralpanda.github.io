Recently, I have been working a lot on improving my productivity and staying motivated on the goals. I already have a huge list of things to do. But I never have scheduled it properly, so that I have a weekly list or monthly Todo list. So I recently came up with a new idea. 

I have been dreaming for a highly productive month for quite a long time. But even if I was able to complete few of my targets, I want to experience a perfect month. A month where you have completed all the set of targets that you have made, in its beginning.

As [Brendon Burchard](http://brendon.com/) used to say
> “Focus goes out of the window, if there is no progress”.

I have created a list of all the prime targets that I need to complete in Next month, which begins tomorrow. 

***

And I have decided to share it in the Social Media. Because,
1. "When you share a good schedule with your friends, there are two things that might happen, that will help us. 
    * They tend to talk about it and ask for updates, often. +Motivation
    * They tend to mock about it and questions every move. +Motivation_indeed
2. "Gives a right morale boost! just wat [The Moral Panda](http://themoralpanda.in) needs.
3. For tiny bit of social pressure, to complete what I have said.

    * Sonna Vaaka Kaapathanum Pressure!

Once I complete this, By 30th of April 2017 or 1st of May 2017 - I will blog about *How much I have done it!*

If this seems a nice idea, you can follow it to by creating ur list of goals.
